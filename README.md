# Fuzzy-Logic-Drive-System
This code, designed to run in matlab, provides a fuzzy logic based collision detection and avoidance for an autonomous vehicle. 
Utilising inputs from five sonar sensors the system can detect how far away an object is, the size of the object and the direction of the object in relation to the vehicle.
